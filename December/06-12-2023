Today i have prepared about IAM users 
I have created one iam users, 
I have try to log in that user without giving any permissions i have try to access in AWS account,
In that i have try to access the s3 bucket its logd in 
After that It dosen't show the existing s3 bucket,
Attaching aws police to the above created user,
Then I have added the S3 full access permission to the user,
I have try to log in again now it will show the all existing s3 buckets access
