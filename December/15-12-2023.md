**To day I performed one small task With Application load balancer:**
 
=> In this task I have created one create one VPC 

=> after that I have created 4 subnets Two for Application load balancer and two for hosting the server.

=> while creating the sub nets we need to choose the particular vpc (what we created already).

=> Here we subnets will create in diffrent availability zones becouse at that time only the ALB is accepts.

=> Here  we need to create Internet gateway to attach that vpc

=> Then we can check these 4 subnets will be configured some Route table.

=> we need add route to the subnets to add the gateway  to this subnet. 

=> In ec2 section we need to create one Application load balancer here
