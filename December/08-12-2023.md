**Scalling & High availability**

Scalability means that an application or sysytem can handle greater loads by adapting

there are two types of scalability

**1)Vertical**

**2)Harizontal scalabilities** 


1. **Vertical scalability**
  
vertical scalability means increasing the size of the instance
for EX: our application runs on a t2.micro we scaling that application runing it on t3.large.

In this Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database.

In this there is a limit to how much you can vertically scale.

**2. Harizantal scalability**

Harizantal scalability means increasing the number of instance or systems for our application.

Harizantal scalability means distributed sysytem.

This is very comman for web applications. 
For Ex:EC2

=> **High availability**

The goal of high availability is servive a data center loss

The high availability can be active for horizantal scaling.

High availabilty usually goes hand in hand with horizantal scaling.

High availability means running your application/system in at least 2 data centers(availability zone)
