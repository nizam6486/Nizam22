**1.Application load balnacer:**
 
  Application Load Balancer is a type of load balancer that distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, 
  
  such as Amazon EC2 instances, in multiple availability zones.  
  
  The ALB can make routing decisions based on content, such as the content of the HTTP header or the URL being reque.
  


**Listener Configuration:**

ALBs use listeners to check for connection requests from clients. A listener is a process that checks for connection requests, using a protocol and port configured for the listener. For example, an HTTP listener might be configured on port 80.

**Routing Decisions:**

ALBs can make routing decisions based on content. For example, an ALB can route requests based on the URL path, host, or other attributes in the HTTP header. This allows for more advanced routing scenarios.

**Target Groups:**

ALBs route traffic to a set of registered targets. Targets are instances (such as EC2 instances) that can handle incoming requests. These targets are grouped into target groups. A target group can include one or more targets.

**Health Checks:**

ALBs continuously monitor the health of registered targets using health checks. If a target is deemed unhealthy, the ALB will stop sending traffic to that target until it passes the health check again.

**Load Balancing Algorithms:**

ALBs use load balancing algorithms to distribute incoming traffic across healthy targets. Common algorithms include round robin, least outstanding requests, and least connections.

**SSL/TLS Termination:**

ALBs can handle SSL/TLS termination, decrypting the incoming encrypted traffic and forwarding it to the targets in an unencrypted form. This helps offload the SSL/TLS processing from the backend servers.

**WebSockets and HTTP/2 Support:**

ALBs support WebSockets and can handle HTTP/2 connections. This is crucial for modern web applications that use these protocols for real-time communication and improved performance.

**Content-Based Routing:**

ALBs can route traffic based on the content of the request. For example, it can route requests to different sets of targets based on the URL path.

**Scalability:**

ALBs can automatically scale to handle varying levels of traffic. They distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple healthy targets, ensuring that no single target is overwhelmed with too much traffic.
In summary, an Application Load Balancer plays a crucial role in distributing incoming application traffic across multiple targets, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability for applications hosted in a cloud environment.
