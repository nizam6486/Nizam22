**Today I have prepared about Cloud watch metrics**

=> cloudwatch provide metrics for every service in aws

=> metric is a avariable to monitor (CPU utilization, network)

=> metrics belongs to namespaces

=> Dimension is a attribute of a metric (instance id, environment)

=> upto 30 dimensions per metric.

=> metrics have timestamps.

=> we can create cloud watch dashboard of metrics.

=> continuesly stream the cloud watch metrics to destination of your choice with real time delevery and low latency.

=> option to filter the metrics to only stream a subset of them.

=> CloudWatch retains metric data for a specified period. Users can configure the retention period based on their requirements.

=> CloudWatch Alarms allow users to set threshold conditions on metrics.When a metric breaches a specified threshold, an alarm is triggered.

=> This can be used to notify users or take automated actions.

**Event:**

CloudWatch Events help automate responses to events in AWS services.
 
Users can define rules based on events and take actions such as invoking Lambda functions or sending notifications.
 
**Integration with Other AWS Services:**

CloudWatch integrates with various AWS services, allowing users to gain insights into the performance of resources like EC2 instances, 

RDS databases, Lambda functions, and more.

**CloudWatch Agent:**

The CloudWatch Agent is a software component that can be installed on servers to collect custom metrics and logs. 

It extends the capabilities of CloudWatch to on-premises servers and hybrid environments.
