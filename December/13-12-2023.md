Network load balancer:

  It is designed to handle TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Unlike an Application Load Balancer (ALB), which operates at the application layer and makes routing decisions based on content, an NLB focuses on distributing network traffic based on IP protocol data.

Listener Configuration:

Similar to an Application Load Balancer, an NLB uses listeners to check for connection requests from clients. A listener is configured with a protocol (TCP, UDP, or TLS) and a port.

Routing Decisions:

NLBs make routing decisions based on IP protocol data, such as the source IP address and port, and distribute traffic to a set of registered targets.

Target Groups:

Targets in the context of an NLB are IP addresses (either Elastic IP addresses or private IP addresses of instances) rather than instances themselves. These targets are grouped into target groups.

Health Checks:

NLBs perform health checks on the registered targets to ensure they are available to handle traffic. If a target is deemed unhealthy, the NLB stops sending traffic to that target until it passes the health check again.

Load Balancing Algorithms:

NLBs use load balancing algorithms to distribute incoming traffic across the registered targets. Common algorithms include round robin and least outstanding requests.

Static IP Addresses:

NLBs provide a static IP address known as the load balancer's DNS name. Clients can use this static IP address to connect to the NLB, and the NLB then distributes the traffic to the registered targets.

Cross-Zone Load Balancing:

NLBs can distribute traffic evenly across targets in multiple availability zones. This helps in achieving high availability and fault tolerance.

TLS Termination:

NLBs support TLS termination, allowing them to handle encrypted traffic. Similar to an ALB, NLBs can decrypt the incoming encrypted traffic and forward it to the targets in an unencrypted form.

Scalability:

NLBs can automatically scale to handle varying levels of traffic. They distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple healthy targets, ensuring that no single target is overwhelmed with too much traffic.
