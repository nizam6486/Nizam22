=>fdisk -l  :It shows the disk will have how many partitions.  

=>df -h  :This command shows human readable format in gb's and where the   
          mounted.

lsblk

file -s /dev/xvdb (this command use for to check the file system available   
                   or not) 
                if not weneed to add the file system for the disk
