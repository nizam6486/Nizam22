Today I prepared about the file system backups:

=> a copy of a file or other item of data made in case the original is lost 

   or damaged.make a backup of any important files

=> The process of copying information or processing status to a redundant 

   system, service, device or medium that can provide the needed processing 

    capability when needed.


=> The term backup has become synonymous with data protection over the past   
   
   several decades and may be accomplished via several methods.

=> Backup software applications reduce the complexity of performing backup   
   
   and recovery operations. 

=> Backing up data is only one part of a disaster protection plan, and may 
   
   not provide the level of data and disaster recovery capabilities desired 
   
   without careful design and testing.
