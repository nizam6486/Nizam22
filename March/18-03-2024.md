**Toady I prepared about Types of system backups:
**
System backup:**

It is the process of copies all our files and stores another place is called system backup. 

=>Data and information to effectively create two versions â€“ one on your  
  original devices and one backup. 

=>It is designed to protect all of your important files and pictures, even  
  the ones you save to an external hard disk.


=>It is used for copying and archiving applications in order not to lose   
  important information.


**Disk backup or Disk cloning:**

=>dd is command-line utility for unix and unix like operating systems  
  whose primary purpose is to convert and copy files.

=>As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backing up the boot sector of a hard drive, and abtaning a fixed amount of random data.

=>to backup or clone an entire hard disk to anether hard disk connected to the same system **we can use the dd command as shown**.

 dd if=<source file name> of=<target file name> [options]
 dd if=</dev/sda of=/dev/sdb

**To backup/disk partition**

 dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/root/sda1.img

**Restoring this image file to other machine after coping this .img**

 dd if=/root/sda1.img of=/dev/sdb3
