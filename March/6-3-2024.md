**Today I prepared about LVM's :Lagical volume Management**
     
=> It means to manage disk space into some partitions is called LVM's
 
=> organising the memory disk space for our requirements into particular  
   blocks. 

=> Here disk spaces we can devided into our required blocks(partitions) in  
   that particular disk space.

=> creates a layer of abstraction over physical storage, which helps you to     
   create logical storage volumes. This provides much greater flexibility in a number of ways than using physical storage directly.

=>there are three types of LVM's are there :

  1.linear volumes
  2.striped volumes
  3.mirrored volumes


**Today i performed one task about Disk partitions** 

=> fdisk: to see the what are the disks are available and to see which disk  
          we need partitioned

   fdisk /dev/xvdb

=> next we need to press for manu (M)

=> here manu will displayed inthat we need to select
