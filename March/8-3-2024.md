**Today i performed one task about Disk partitions** 

=> fdisk: to see the what are the disks are available and to see which disk  
          we need partitioned

   fdisk /dev/xvdb

root@ip-172-31-20-221:~# **fdisk /dev/xvdb**

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.37.2).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

This disk is currently in use - repartitioning is probably a bad idea.
It's recommended to umount all file systems, and swapoff all swap
partitions on this disk.


Command (m for help): **m** 

=>**(next we need to press for manu (m))** here menu will displayed

 Generic
   d   delete a partition
   F   list free unpartitioned space
   l   list known partition types
   n   add a new partition
   p   print the partition table
   t   change a partition type
   v   verify the partition table
   i   print information about a partition

  Misc
   m   print this menu
   u   change display/entry units
   x   extra functionality (experts only)

  Script
   I   load disk layout from sfdisk script file
   O   dump disk layout to sfdisk script file

  Save & Exit
   w   write table to disk and exit
   q   quit without saving changes

  Create a new label
   g   create a new empty GPT partition table
   G   create a new empty SGI (IRIX) partition table
   o   create a new empty DOS partition table
   s   create a new empty Sun partition table



=> **In this menu we can select (n)**
     
All space for primary partitions is in use.
Adding logical partition 5
First sector (4096-16777215, default 4096):
Last sector, +/-sectors or +/-size{K,M,G,T,P} (4096-16777215, default 16777215): **+2G**(how much we wont required)

Created a new partition 5 of type 'Linux' and of size 2 GiB.

=> **nexte we need to select (p), (Here we can see the partition is   
                                    created)**

Disk /dev/xvdb: 8 GiB, 8589934592 bytes, 16777216 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos

Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors Size Id Type

**/dev/xvdb5       4096  4198399  4194304   2G 83 Linux**

**next we change the file system to linux to LVMs**
for that we need to take the (t) option:

Command (m for help): t

**Here it is asked which partition then we can enter our partition number**
 
Partition number (1,5, default 5): 5

**For lvm's code is "8e"**

Hex code or alias (type L to list all): 8e

Changed type of partition 'Linux' to 'Linux LVM'.

**Next save and exit with (wq) **

**next we can intimate to that particular disk the disk will be partitioned
to use this command**

      partprobe /dev/xvdb


**and finally we check the whether the done or not**

to check with **lsblk**

**Next here we can create another disk partion:** 

=> fdisk: to see the what are the disks are available and to see which disk  
          we need partitioned

   fdisk /dev/xvda1
