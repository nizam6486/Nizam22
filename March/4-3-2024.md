**Today i prepared about Disk management sysytem:**

If we can learning about the disk management sysytem at first we need to know how boot the linux server 

In that process we have to know the process of booting sysytem:

**System Run level**:

**main run level:**

0 = shutdown the system
1 = Single-user mode
6 = reboot the sysytem

****Other run level*:**

2.Multiuser mode without networking.
3.Multiuser mode with networking.
5.Multiuser mode with networking and GUI.

(Run level 4 is undifined not used and user definable.)

**Booting process**

Every time we press poweron button in our computer it goes BIOS. It like system intigrity checks those are bootloader floopy and cd rom like wise

MBR (Master Boot Record):

GRUB: (Grand unifined bootloader)

Here we can install multiple kernel images, we can choose which ever we wontwe can install.
