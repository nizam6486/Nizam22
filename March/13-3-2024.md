Swap:

=> We can use Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical     
   
   memory (RAM) is full.

=> If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive
  
   pages in memory are moved to the swap space. 

=> While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should
  
   not be considered a replacement for more RAM.

=> Swap space in Linux is an extension of physical RAM, offering virtual 
   
   memory that helps maintain system stability and performance. 

=> It allows processes to continue running when RAM is fully used and  
   
   prevents memory errors.
