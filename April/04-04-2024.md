**Today I am preparing about:**

Ownership command:

=>The owner of a file can decide who has the right to read the file, to  
  write to the file (make changes to it), or, if the file is a command, to execute the file.

=>The owner is generally the user who created the file. Each user also 
  belongs to a default group, and that group is assigned to every file the user creates. You can create many groups, though, and assign each user to multiple groups.
