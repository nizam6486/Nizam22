Today I am Preparing about:

**what is Networking:**

=>Every computer is connected to some other computer through a network  
  whether internally or externally to exchange some information. 

=>This network can be small as some computers connected in your home or  
  office.

=>Networks can be as small as two computers connected at your home and as 
  large as in a large company or connected systems worldwide known as Internet. 

=>Linux operating system has a very strong set of networking instruments to  
  provide and manage routing, bridging, virtual networks and monitoring.


**Network components:**

Inter face detection

Assigninig an ip adress

interface configuration file


IP

Subnet mask

Gate way

Static Vs DHCP

**
Network files and commands**:


**ip**

=>The ip command is one of the basic commands every administrator will need  
  in daily work, from setting up new systems and assigning IPs to troubleshooting existing systems. 

=>The ip command can show address information, manipulate routing, plus  
  display network various devices, interfaces, and tunnels.
